# Meaningful-Text-Project
Given a list of extracted sentences from company about pages, deploy machine learning classifiers to determine whether or not the text contains descriptive content.    

Descriptive content is any sentence from a company’s website that indicates one or more of the following:   
•	Products/Services    
•	Market Segment, Market Profile or Market Location     
•	Value Proposition or Company Purpose     

Note: For proprietary reasons, I cannot disclose the datasets to public.
